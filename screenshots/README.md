- Capture the responsive design on different screen sizes if needed

### File Naming Convention
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `feature-name.png`

- Match the names referenced in README.md

## How to Add Screenshots

1. **Take Screenshots**:
   - Use browser developer tools to set consistent viewport size
   - Use screenshot tools like Lightshot, Snagit, or browser extensions
   - Ensure good lighting and contrast

2. **Optimize Images**:
   - Compress images to reduce file size (use tools like TinyPNG)
   - Maintain quality while keeping files under 1MB each

3. **Add to Repository**:
   - Place files in this `screenshots/` directory
   - Update README.md if filenames change
   - Commit with descriptive messages

## Alternative: Placeholder Images

If you cannot take screenshots immediately, you can:

1. Create placeholder images with the correct dimensions
2. Use design tools like Figma or Canva to create mockups
3. Add actual screenshots later when the application is fully deployed

## Mobile Screenshots (Optional)

Consider adding mobile screenshots for:
- Responsive design demonstration
- Mobile-specific features
- Touch interface elements

Place mobile screenshots in a `mobile/` subdirectory and reference them in the README.md if needed.
